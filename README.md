# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software.
Importance
i) They design and implement software programs on various platforms using a variety of coding languages.
ii) They design various software programs that are tailored to meet user expectations and solve certain problems.
iii)Use engineering and programming principles to develop operating systems and application software that enables users interact with computer hardware


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Emergence of structured programming. Movement away from machine code to more human like language created need for organized code with concepts such as modularity and control were implemented.
ii) Introduction of Object Oriented Programming. Code could be handled as objects with properties. This offered better code reusability and maintanance
iii) Agile methodologies. A shift from previous models like waterfall now offered iterative and incremental developement giving empahisis to flexibility and collaboration and rapid feedback loops .


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Planning - define the problem, software goals, scope and the timeline for the project.
ii) Requirements analysis- Determine the needs for the software to meet its specific goals.
iii)Design - Create a prototype for the software
iv) Coding- Use various languages to develop the softtware.
v) Testing - Run various scenarious to ensure the software is free from errors and meet the set goals.
vi) Deployment- Release the software to the users.
vii) Maintanance- Collect feedback from users and fix any arising issues with the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies follows a linear and sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile methodology is iterative and flexible allowing for continious feedback and adjustments throghout the lifecycle.
Diffrences
i)Waterfall there is low flexibility and changes are hard to incorporate while in agile is highly flexible and adapts tp changing requirements.
ii)Waterfall user feedback comes later after product is developed while agile regular feedback is incorporated in every sprint.
iii) Waterfall testing is done at the end of development while in Agile testing is done after every iteration.
When to use:
Waterfall


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
