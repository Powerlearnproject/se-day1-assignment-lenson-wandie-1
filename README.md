Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software.
Importance
i) They design and implement software programs on various platforms using a variety of coding languages.
ii) They design various software programs that are tailored to meet user expectations and solve certain problems.
iii)Use engineering and programming principles to develop operating systems and application software that enables users interact with computer hardware


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Emergence of structured programming. Movement away from machine code to more human like language created need for organized code with concepts such as modularity and control were implemented.
ii) Introduction of Object Oriented Programming. Code could be handled as objects with properties. This offered better code reusability and maintenance
iii) Agile methodologies. A shift from previous models like waterfall now offered iterative and incremental development giving emphasis to flexibility and collaboration and rapid feedback loops .


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Planning - define the problem, software goals, scope and the timeline for the project.
ii) Requirements analysis- Determine the needs for the software to meet its specific goals.
iii)Design - Create a prototype for the software
iv) Coding- Use various languages to develop the software.
v) Testing - Run various scenarios to ensure the software is free from errors and meet the set goals.
vi) Deployment- Release the software to the users.
vii) Maintenance- Collect feedback from users and fix any arising issues with the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies follows a linear and sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile methodology is iterative and flexible allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments throughout the lifecycle.
Differences
i)Waterfall there is low flexibility and changes are hard to incorporate while in agile is highly flexible and adapts tp changing requirements.
ii)Waterfall user feedback comes later after product is developed while agile regular feedback is incorporated in every sprint.
iii) Waterfall testing is done at the end of development while in Agile testing is done after every iteration.
When to use:
Waterfall
i) Projects with minimum requirements and low uncertainity.
ii) Projects where timeline and budget is crucial.
iii) Projects with well established technology and processes.

Agile:
i) Projects with evolving requirements and minimal uncertainity.
ii) Projects with high level uncertainity or risk
iii) Projects where customer feedback is critical.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Engineer:
Responsible for designing, developing and testing the code.

QA Engineer: 
ensures software meets quality standards by testing throughout the development process.

Project Manager:
Overseees the entire project, managing timelines, resources and communication to ensure successful delivery on time and within budget.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs increase developer productivity, improve code quality and streamline project management. Example: IntelliJ IDEA.

VCS: help developers collaborate more efficiently and effectively.
Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Collaboration issues: clear communication is key between designers QA Engineers and Project Managers.
Strategy: Effective Leadership by Project Managers and leveraging collaboration tools such as github

Changing User Requirements: User requiremnts are dynamic and can't be all captured.
Strategy: Agile Methodologies to collect user feedback and incorporate it into development.

Burnout: Tight deadlines may lead to engineers overexerting themselves leading to lower productivity.
Strategy: Effective time management - Setting realistic deadlines and utilizing project management tools to optimize development workflow.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:
Validates the function of a specific part of a software.
Performed during the initial phases of software development.

Integration testing
Confirms that the diffrent modules and services work well together e.g software is compatible with database.

System testing 
Checks if the software or product meets the requirements specified in the project.
Testing the entire integrated systems with both positive and negative test cases.

User acceptance testing
Final testing phase where actual users test to ensure it meets the expectation.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is the process of writing instructions to get the best from an ai model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: What is the best route from Nairobi to Mombasa.

Improved Prompt: Suggest the best route from Nairobi to Mombasa with criteria such as little to no traffic, mode of transport is a 4 door sedan and traveling at night.
